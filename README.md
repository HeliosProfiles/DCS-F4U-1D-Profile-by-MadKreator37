This is a Helios profile for [Magnitude 3's F4U-1D for DCS](https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/products/planes/corsair/) designed for DCS World and contributed by @MadKreator37 . 
This profile utilises an updated set of JSON interfaces which have been contributed to was written into the Helios Virtual Cockpit project called **Helios**.  This can be downloaded from [Helios latest release](https://github.com/HeliosVirtualCockpit/Helios/releases/latest)

### IMPORTANT!
You *MUST* be running Helios 1.6.6140 minimum. Please visit the link above to download the latest releases of both.

### ABOUT
This profile was designed and created by MadKreator37. All parts were cut and modified from the 3D model of the F4U-1D cockpit. Every piece used is specific to the F4U.  
 *NOTE* The added functions: Keys panel( f-Keys, Briefing, ReArm etc), Kneeboard, and Markpoint functions are made with an English Keyboard format and require the default DCS keybindings for them to work properly. If you have altered any of these or are using a non-english keyboard, then some functions may not work as intended. You may have to bind them to the correct actions in the Keyboard Interface.

*Special thanks to @BluefinBima for his contributions and assistance as always! And to Nonobeardunord for the lua scripting tips!*

### Known Bugs and Issues

1: Cockpit warning lights( Stall, Rocket Box, BatBomb) may or may not function correctly-- lack of exposed devices in cockpit files

4: No Oxygen controls or gauges-- not implemented in module yet

5: Recognition light keying button does not function-- no definitions in cockpit files

6: Rocket Box Pylon indicator- WIP- not definitions in cockpit files, but should cycle following hotas rocket release command

7: !!! Position 6 on C-38 radio channel selector can cause DCS crash-- Reported to Mag3 (causes error in F4U_avionics.dll) !!!

8: Clock does not have all functions-- not implemented in module, or commands not exposed in cockpit files

### Notes

-Due to the wide range of displays, monitors, TV's and tablets,  I cannot guarantee exact brightness levels or color accuracy results from user to user. This is not something I have any control of. If you have visual issues (too bright or too dark etc)  please calibrate your display and/or adjust settings in your GPU's software, brightness, contrast, sharpness, gamma, digital vibrance etc. It will probably enhance all other profiles as well. During testing, the profile was used and shown on multiple types, sizes, and resolutions of displays to rule out any "game breaking" visuals. However, please keep in mind that it is impossible for me to account for every scenario.

-*Remember to always make a back up of files before making changes*
